# mini_junsunix_shell
Mini Unix shell implemented in C    
## Objective
Wrote a simple shell to interact with Linux machines that is capable of handling signals (SIGCHLD, SIGTSTP, SIGINT), parsing commands, command error checking, and handling multi-commands, with built in commands that include quit, fg (put process in foreground), bg (continue suspended process in background), slay (terminates process), and jobs (display information of processes not terminated)

## Reflection
I wanted to see how code can be messy and unreadable if I don't separate functions into smaller files.    
Will apply concept of modularity for next programs
